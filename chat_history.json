    "content": "1) SHORT ANSWER\nThe provided evidence does not contain a template or draft for an employment contract for Sarah Ahmed as a manager, nor does it specify a salary of PKR 80,000. The documents primarily discuss general terms and conditions related to contract appointments, extensions, and termination within a Pakistani legal context.\n\n2) OVERVIEW\nThe supplied legal excerpts primarily pertain to the general principles governing contract appointments in Pakistan. They detail aspects such as the tenure of contracts, conditions for extension, grounds and notice periods for termination, the non-conferment of rights for regular appointment or seniority, and the role of appointing authorities in settling terms and conditions. The evidence refers to various court cases and rules concerning contractual employment but does not provide specific contractual language for a new hire.\n\n3) GROUNDS / RULES\n*   **Contract Tenure and Extension**: Employment contracts are for a specific period (e.g., 1.5 years or 5 years) and may be extendable depending upon performance [2, 3]. Professional qualifications may be a condition for contract extension [3]. The Appointing Authority, with Board approval, may extend the contract and re-negotiate new terms and conditions [4].\n*   **Non-conferment of Regular Appointment/Seniority**: Contract appointments do not confer any right of regular appointment to the post nor towards seniority [2, 4].\n*   **Termination of Contracts**: Contract appointments are liable to termination on one-month's notice or one-month's pay in lieu thereof, on either side, without assigning any reason [2, 4]. However, employees may not be able to exercise their right to terminate before the completion of the initial contract period (e.g., one and a half year) [2].\n*   **Settlement of Terms and Conditions**: The terms and conditions of contract appointment are settled by the Appointing Authority [4].\n*   **Regulation by Rules**: Services of contract employees are regulated by binding Contract Appointment Rules, which may possess statutory protection [5].\n\n4) EVIDENCE\n1.  **Appellant's Consideration and Accommodation**: Discusses an appellant's case, consideration by a subcommittee, denial of representation, and the appellant's illegal occupation of official accommodation after contract expiry [1].\n2.  **Job Offer Letter Clauses**: Details important clauses from a job offer letter regarding contract tenure (1.5 years, extendable), non-conferment of regular appointment/seniority, and termination conditions (one-month notice/pay in lieu) [2].\n3.  **Educator Contract Period**: Describes contract appointments for educators for an initial period of 5 years, extendable for another 5 years based on good performance, with a condition for acquiring professional qualification within three years [3].\n4.  **Contract Appointment Rules**: Outlines procedures for contract appointment, extension by the Appointing Authority, re-negotiation of terms, and Rule 6 which specifies terms and conditions like non-conferment of regular appointment and termination on one-month's notice [4].\n5.  **Regulation of Service Contracts**: States that employees' services under their service contracts are regulated by binding Contract Appointment Rules, which are protected statutorily [5].\n\n5) JUDGMENT SUMMARIES\n*   **Judgment Summary 1 (from doc_id=49119ca74d462aa799b45dc79b3cbd2cacb3d1d2)**\n    *   **Case details**: Insufficient evidence (Parties: Appellant vs. Respondents in ICA No.72508 /2017, related to Writ Petition No. 35198/2017; Court: Insufficient evidence; Date of judgment: Insufficient evidence; Citation: Insufficient evidence).\n    *   **Factual Summary**: The Appellant was considered by a Sub Committee in compliance with a court order, but their representation was declined on legal grounds [1]. The Respondents argued that the proceedings were a device to prolong the Appellant's illegal occupation of official accommodation, asserting the Appellant was a mere licensee not entitled to retain possession after contract expiry [1].\n    *   **Holding/Result**: The representation of the Appellant was declined [1].\n    *   **Reasoning**:\n        *   The Appellant was duly considered and afforded an opportunity of hearing [1].\n        *   The Appellant's contract had expired, rendering him a mere licensee no longer entitled to official accommodation [1].\n\n*   **Judgment Summary 2 (from doc_id=5bac0a30a6926fdc55fbb4e658e755d030e708d4)**\n    *   **Case details**: Insufficient evidence (Parties: Appellants; Court: Insufficient evidence; Date of judgment: Order dated 20.06.2018 mentioned for extension; Citation: Insufficient evidence).\n    *   **Factual Summary**: Appellants accepted terms of a Job Offer Letter, which stipulated a 1.5-year contract tenure (extendable), no right to regular appointment/seniority, and termination on one-month's notice or pay in lieu [2]. After the initial period, their contracts were extended for four months, but their performance was later found unsatisfactory [2].\n    *   **Holding/Result**: Appellants' contracts were extended, but performance was later found unsatisfactory [2].\n    *   **Reasoning**:\n        *   Appellants duly agreed and accepted the terms and conditions in the Job Offer Letter [2].\n        *   Clause 3 of the offer letter allowed for extension depending upon performance [2].\n\n*   **Judgment Summary 3 (from doc_id=81a4a2dc874e067e0d51cab9a46d39c4f7a785f7)**\n    *   **Case details**: Insufficient evidence (Parties: Educators; Court: Insufficient evidence; Date of judgment: Insufficient evidence; Citation: W.P. No.256/2019).\n    *   **Factual Summary**: Educators were appointed on contract for an initial period of 5 years under the recruitment policy 2012 [3]. Their contracts, common in all service contracts, included a clause for potential extension for another 5 years based on good performance and required acquiring a professional qualification within three years for extension [3].\n    *   **Holding/Result**: Appointments were on contract for an initial period of 5 years, subject to extension conditions [3].\n    *   **Reasoning**:\n        *   Appointments were made under the recruitment policy 2012 [3].\n        *   Clause 4 of the letter of agreement explicitly detailed the period of contract and conditions for extension [3].\n\n*   **Judgment Summary 4 (from doc_id=c2759b99c6a6aee1bac85c4e0e14da213dc2bf16)**\n    *   **Case details**: Insufficient evidence (Parties: Insufficient evidence; Court: Insufficient evidence; Date of judgment: Insufficient evidence; Citation: W.P No.16223/2014, W.P. No.13664/2014, W.P. No.13669/2014).\n    *   **Factual Summary**: This document discusses rules for contract appointment, including the Appointing Authority's role in forwarding requisitions, extending contracts, and settling terms and conditions [4]. Rule 6 of the Contract Appointment Rules is quoted, stating that such appointments do not confer rights for regular appointment and allow for termination on one month's notice or pay in lieu [4].\n    *   **Holding/Result**: The terms and conditions of contract appointment are settled by the Appointing Authority and generally include clauses for non-regular appointment and notice-based termination [4].\n    *   **Reasoning**:\n        *   The Appointing Authority has the power to settle terms and conditions [4].\n        *   Rule 6 explicitly outlines these standard terms for contract appointments [4].\n\n*   **Judgment Summary 5 (from doc_id=40753e3b66d51dcaa5be35a5468d5064759e3535)**\n    *   **Case details**: Insufficient evidence (Parties: Petitioners vs. Foundation; Court: High Court; Date of judgment: Insufficient evidence; Citation: Insufficient evidence).\n    *   **Factual Summary**: Petitioners were employed by a Foundation and their services were governed by binding Contract Appointment Rules, which they unequivocally accepted [5]. The document notes that when services are protected by statutory rules, any violation of service benefits and rights by authorities may lead to the High Court exercising its constitutional jurisdiction [5].\n    *   **Holding/Result**: The Petitioners established they were governed by statutory rules of service, and their services were regulated by binding Contract Appointment Rules [5].\n    *   **Reasoning**:\n        *   Employees accepted the terms and conditions of employment [5].\n        *   The Contract Appointment Rules do not lack statutory protection [5].\n\n6) STATUTORY TEXT\n*   \"6. Terms and Conditions of Contract Appointment:- (1) The terms and conditions of contract appointment will be settled by the Appointing Authority. (2) Without prejudice to the generality of above said:- (a) Such appointment will not confer any right for regular appointment; (b) The Appointing Authority may, without assigning any reason, terminate services of the contract employee on one month’s notice or one month’s pay in lieu thereof\" [4].\n\n7) PRACTICAL TEMPLATE or DRAFT\nInsufficient evidence.

    "content": "1) SHORT ANSWER\nTo draft a notice for breach of contract due to payment being overdue, based on the provided evidence, it should be framed as a \"final notice of demand\" [1]. This notice should clearly demand the payment of the outstanding amount within a specified timeframe, such as thirty days from the date of service [1]. Failure to pay a sum of money on a specified day constitutes a breach of contract [4, 2], and compensation for such a breach typically involves the principal sum along with interest up to the day of payment [4]. The evidence does not provide a comprehensive general template for drafting such a notice beyond these core elements.\n\n2) OVERVIEW\nThe provided evidence outlines that the failure to make a payment by a specified date constitutes a breach of contract [2, 4]. In such situations, the aggrieved party is entitled to compensation, usually comprising the principal sum and interest [4, 3]. The concept of a \"final notice of demand\" is supported, especially in contexts like mortgage payments, where payment is demanded within a set period, such as thirty days [1]. However, a specific, generalized template for drafting such a notice for any breach of contract due to overdue payment is not explicitly provided.\n\n3) GROUNDS / RULES\n*   Failure to pay a sum of money on a specified day constitutes a breach of contract [4, 2].\n*   When a contract is breached due to non-payment, the party in default must make compensation for the loss sustained [2].\n*   Compensation for the breach of a contract to pay a sum of money on a specified day is generally limited to the principal sum contracted to be paid, together with interest up to the day of payment [4, 3].\n*   A \"final notice of demand\" can be served, requiring the payment of outstanding money within a specific period, such as thirty days from service [1].\n\n4) EVIDENCE\n1.  **Mortgage payment demand notice details**: A mortgagor can be served a final notice of demand requiring payment of outstanding mortgage money within thirty days from service. Upon service, powers of the mortgagor regarding rent recovery transfer to the financial institution [1].\n2.  **Examples of contract breach and compensation**: Illustrates cases where a party fails to perform their contractual obligation, such as not providing cargo, not furnishing materials, or not paying within a week, leading to the other party being relieved of their obligations and the defaulting party making compensation [2].\n3.  **Consequences of breach of contract**: Lists chapters related to contract law, including the consequence of breach of contract and provisions for compensation for loss or damage caused by such breach [3].\n4.  **Compensation for non-payment**: Clarifies that if a sum of money is not paid on a specified day, the defaulting party is liable to make good the principal sum and interest up to the day of payment [4].\n5.  **Court recognition of payments**: Addresses the procedure for certifying out-of-court payments or adjustments to a court executing a decree, requiring payment through bank, postal money-order, or written adjustment signed by the decree-holder [5].\n\n5) JUDGMENT SUMMARIES\nInsufficient evidence. The provided documents are excerpts from legal texts or statutes, not judgment summaries.\n\n6) STATUTORY TEXT\n*   \"mortgagor demanding the payment of the mortgage money outstanding within thirty days from service of the final notice on the customer.\" [1]\n*   \"CHAPTER VI OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF BREACH OF CONTRACT 73. Compensation for loss or damage caused by breach of contract\" [3]\n*   \"A does not pay the money on that day; B...A is not liable to make good to B anything except the principal sum he contracted to pay, together with interest up to the day of payment.\" [4]\n*   \"Any payment not made in the manner provided in rule 1 or any adjustment not made in writing shall not be recognized by the Court executing the decree.\" [5]\n\n7) PRACTICAL TEMPLATE or DRAFT\nBased on the provided evidence, a general template for a notice of breach of contract due to payment overdue cannot be comprehensively drafted. However, the evidence from the context of a \"final notice of demand\" for mortgage money [1] allows for the construction of the following essential elements:\n\n**[Your Company Letterhead/Details]**\n\n**[Date]**\n\n**[Recipient's Name]**\n**[Recipient's Address]**\n\n**Subject: FINAL NOTICE OF DEMAND for Overdue Payment**\n\nDear [Recipient's Name],\n\nThis serves as a final notice of demand for the payment of the outstanding amount of [Specify Overdue Amount, e.g., \"PKR X,XXX,XXX\"] under [Reference to the original contract/agreement, if any, though not explicitly stated in evidence] which was due on [Original Due Date].\n\nYou are hereby required to make the payment of the aforementioned outstanding amount within **thirty (30) days** from the date of service of this notice.\n\nPlease note that failure to pay the sum of money on the specified day constitutes a breach of contract, which may result in further action to recover the principal sum together with applicable interest up to the day of payment, as provided by law.\n\nSincerely,\n\n**[Your Name/Authorized Signatory]**\n**[Your Title]**\n**[Your Company Name]**"
